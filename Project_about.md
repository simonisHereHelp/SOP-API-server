   - Following the stripping procedure outlined in **SOP-0299 Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Precautions and Handling**, strip approximately 4mm of the outer jacket from each colored coaxial cable using a blade breaker (MFG-0355).

3. **Separate Outer Conductor:**
   - As specified in **SOP-0299**, separate the outer conductors from the dielectric insulator by pulling the insulator off the coaxial cable. Use tweezers to twist the conductors tightly together while rotating the outer jacket with the opposite hand.

4. **Strip Dielectric Insulator:**
   - Strip the dielectric insulator using a blade breaker (MFG-0355), ensuring approximately 1mm of dielectric insulation remains on the prepped wire, as required by **PRT-0638 Assembly, Catheter, SLT, OTW, 0.018, 150cm**.

5. **Apply Solder Paste and Tin Conductors:**
   - Apply a thin layer of solder paste to the outer and center conductors using a spatula (MFG-1035), then tin the conductors using the soldering system set to 350°C (MFG-1201), in accordance with **QTI-0781 Test Instruction, Impedance, Catheter Components, Subassemblies, and Assemblies**.

6. **Cut Conductors to Final Length:**
   - Trim the outer and center conductors to the final length as specified in **PRT-0638 Assembly, Catheter, SLT, OTW, 0.018, 150cm**.

7. **Position Bridgeboard:**
   - Secure the bridgeboard circuit (PRT-0427-026) in the circuit board holder (MFG-1314) per **SOP-0012**.

8. **Pre-Wet Circuit Pads:**
   - Pre-wet the circuit ground and signal pads on both the front and back sides of the bridgeboard circuit using solder and a soldering station (MFG-1201) in compliance with **QTI-0781**.

9. **Solder Outer Conductor Wires:**
   - Following **SOP-0012**, use tweezers to hold the outer conductor wires against the pre-wetted circuit ground pad. Solder the wires to the circuit using the soldering station set to 350°C, and trim excess wires as necessary.

10. **Solder Center Conductor Wires:**
    - Position the insulator jacket adjacent to the pre-wetted circuit signal pad, ensuring the exposed center conductor wires cover 25-75% of the pad length as specified in **QTI-0781**. Solder the wires to the circuit and trim excess conductor wires as necessary.

11. **Clean Circuit:**
    - Clean the circuit of excess solder using an antistatic swab and 70% alcohol, in line with **SOP-0299**.

12. **Repeat Soldering for Back Face:**
    - Repeat the soldering process for the back face of the bridgeboard circuit as outlined in **PRT-0638**.

13. **In-Process Inspection:**
    - Perform a visual inspection of the soldered conductors, verifying the following criteria specified in **QTI-0841 Inspection Instruction, Dimensional and Visual**:
        - Correct color order of coaxial cables.
        - Both outer and center conductors are properly tinned to their respective pads.
        - The center conductor is positioned correctly within the boundaries of the signal pad.
        - The dielectric insulator is not deformed and is positioned correctly.

#### 7.2 Preparation and Soldering of Distal End of Micro-Coaxial Cables to Transducer Circuit

1. **Insert Mandrel:**
   - In line with **SOP-0012**, insert a 0.0195” Teflon-coated mandrel (PRT-0427-026) through the distal end of the central lumen.

2. **Strip Outer Jacket:**
   - Following **SOP-0299**, strip approximately 4mm of the proximal end of the micro-coaxial cable outer jacket using a blade breaker (MFG-0355).

3. **Separate Outer Conductor:**
   - In compliance with **PRT-0638**, separate the outer conductors from the dielectric insulator, and cut approximately half of the outer conductors closest to the stripped edge of the outer jacket using wire cutters. Twist the remaining outer conductors tightly together.

4. **Strip Dielectric Insulator:**
   - Strip the dielectric insulator from the colored coaxial cable using a blade breaker (MFG-0355), leaving approximately 1mm as specified in **PRT-0638**.

5. **Apply Solder Paste and Tin Conductors:**
   - Apply a thin layer of solder paste to the outer and center conductors using a spatula (MFG-1035). Tin the conductors using the soldering system and chisel tip set to 350°C (MFG-1201), following the guidelines in **QTI-0781**.

6. **Solder to Ground Pad:**
   - Solder the outer conductor wires to the ground pad using the soldering system set to 150°C. Apply flux as necessary for good solder wetting, in accordance with **SOP-0012**. Clean flux residue as needed with isopropyl alcohol.

7. **Solder to Signal Pad:**
   - Position the center conductor wires over the signal pad, ensuring they do not contact the outer conductor wires. Solder the center conductor wires to the signal pad using the soldering system set to 150°C, as specified in **QTI-0781**.

8. **In-Process Inspection:**
   - Inspect the soldered connections, ensuring they meet the workmanship standards outlined in **QTI-0841**:
       - Correct pad coverage.
       - No heat-induced damage to the dielectric insulator.
       - Proper alignment and attachment of conductors.
